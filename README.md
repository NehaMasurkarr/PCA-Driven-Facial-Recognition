# PCA-Driven-Facial-Recognition
This project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA on the Olivetti face dataset for dimensionality reduction and image processing . It demonstrates how PCA can enhance facial recognition by extracting key features, visualizing eigenfaces, and reconstructing images, showcasing advanced techniques in data analysis and machine learning.
