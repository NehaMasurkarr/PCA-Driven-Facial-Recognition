# PCA-Driven-Facial-Recognition
This project implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and image processing using the Olivetti face dataset. It demonstrates how PCA can enhance facial recognition by extracting key features, visualizing eigenfaces, and reconstructing images, showcasing advanced techniques in data analysis and machine learning.
